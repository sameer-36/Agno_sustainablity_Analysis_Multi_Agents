#  Sustainability Task Force – Multi-Agent AI
Dashboard
An interactive **Streamlit dashboard** powered by **Agno multi-agents** to research and propose
sustainable city solutions.
This project was developed as part of the **Agno Agents Lab: Mission Sustainability**.
##  Features
- **Multi-Agent System** – 4 specialized AI agents with distinct roles:
- **News Analyst** → Finds recent sustainability news & green city projects.
- **Data Analyst** → Analyzes environmental datasets (CSV) & auto-generates charts.
- **Policy Reviewer** → Summarizes official government sustainability policies.
- **Innovations Scout** → Identifies cutting-edge urban green technologies.
- **Task Force Mode** – All agents collaborate to produce a single **Sustainability Proposal**.
- **Beautiful Dashboard UI** – Card-based layout with icons, modern styling, and wide-screen
support.
- **Data Upload & Visualization** – Upload environmental CSV files → preview + auto-generated
charts.
- **History Tracking** – View past queries & results in expandable sections.
- **Export Reports** – Download results as Markdown or Text files.
## Demo
- Enter a **research topic** (e.g., “How can our city improve air quality?”).
- Choose an **agent** (or full Task Force).
- Upload CSV (if using Data Analyst).
- Click **Run Analysis** n → Get detailed insights.
## Project Structure

##  Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sustainability-taskforce.git
cd sustainability-taskforce
```
2. **Create a virtual environment & install dependencies**
```bash

```
##  Example Use Case
- The **News Analyst** finds reports on new urban green initiatives.
- The **Data Analyst** analyzes uploaded air quality datasets, generating statistical summaries and
charts.
- The **Policy Reviewer** summarizes government climate and urban policies.
- The **Innovations Scout** discovers emerging technologies (e.g., vertical farming, smart grids).
- The **Task Force** integrates all findings into a **comprehensive sustainability proposal**.
## Tech Stack
- Streamlit → Interactive UI
- Agno → Multi-agent framework
- Groq → LLM backend
- Pandas → Data analysis
- Matplotlib → Data visualization
##  Future Improvements
- Tabbed interface for smoother navigation
- Integration with live sustainability datasets/APIs
